# YieldScan
Scanning yield on nominated proof-of-stake networks. Starting with Kusama.

## Currently supported networks <a name = "supported_networks"></a>

## Description <a name = "description"></a>
We aim to solve the problems of information asymmetry and lack of transparency that are faced by the Polkadot community in identifying returns on staking, which incurs time and capital costs to nominators in taking staking decisions.

This project is funded and supported by the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/) - under [Wave 6](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/accepted_grant_applications.md#wave-6).
